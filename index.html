<h1>The Marriage Bet</h1>
<h2>$1,000 each</h2>
<p> This is the website to submit your answers for our group long term bet. Anyone who correctly guesses the order in which all twelve members of Senor Beer get married, will receive 1000 dollars from everyone else who submitted answers.</p>

<p> A few rules as decided by the group:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The bet is by date of the wedding, not engagement</li>
		<li> Only date of first marriage is counted</li>
		<li> Each person's #1 pick will be revealed at the beginning, but all other picks will be hidden</li>
	</ul>
<p> Submit your picks <a href=picks.html>Here</a>

<p>Here's a website with better drop down menus then mine. The menus are interactive based on the mouse floating. One additional change I'd like to make to the website is making the drop down lists exclusive. If "Wyatt" is selected in one drop down menu, he should not be an option in the rest of the menus</p><a href =http://cssmenumaker.com/blog/top-8-clean-drop-down-menu-examples>See more</a>
